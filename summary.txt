-	Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
-	My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.
-	So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"
-	She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.
-	And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.
-	But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.
-	And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
-	If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
-	So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
-	You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
-	Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.
-	But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
-	I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
-	The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
-	When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."
-	The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
-	I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
-	Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.
-	Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
-	Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
-	Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.
-	On the back cover of their f inal issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
