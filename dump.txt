The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be traced back to ancient times, with philosophical discussions about the nature of intelligence and the possibility of creating artificial beings. However, the formal inception of AI as a field of study began in the mid-20th century. In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined during the Dartmouth Conference, where pioneers such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert A. Simon gathered to explore the possibilities of creating intelligent machines. The early years saw optimism and ambitious goals, but progress was slower than anticipated. In the 1960s and 1970s, AI research faced challenges, leading to the "AI winter." The field experienced renewed interest and breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s, driven by advancements in machine learning and expert systems. The 21st century has witnessed unprecedented growth in AI, with breakthroughs in deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics, transforming AI from a theoretical concept to a pervasive force shaping various aspects of modern life.
